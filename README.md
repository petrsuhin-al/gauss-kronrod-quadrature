# Gauss-Kronrod Quadrature

Implementation of the Gauss-Kronrod algorithm for quadrature formulas in Python. You can change the number of nodes using enum. The main code that executes the algorithm is in file gauss_kronrod.py.
There is also an implementation with parallelization of calculations - it was in the ```with-multiprocessing-version``` branch.
